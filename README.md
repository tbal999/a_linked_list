# a_linked_list
building a linked list console app - just my attempt at making a linked list.
Has some bugs.

functionality:
add, delete, print, quit

add - adds a string to the list by an index.
delete - lets you delete an item from the list by index
print - lets you print the list
rprint - lets you print the list in reverse from a selected index.
